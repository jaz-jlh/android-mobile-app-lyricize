Results of searches now show up in a scrollable, clickable list view

Added Radio buttons and functionality to search by song, artist, album, or playlist (all with Spotify API)

When a song is clicked on, the lyrics are found by a MusixMatch API call. The lyrics are then thrown IBM's Watson Tone Analyzer and the raw data is displayed on a new activity. (polished page being worked on)

Search results are saved to the file, and history of searches can be viewed through the history button.

GPS coordinates are saved with the search names in the file. (toast shows that GPS service starts)

More error handling with search inputs for Spotify, MusixMatch and, Watson Tone Analyzer.
