This app is a music tone analyzer tool. Using Spotify’s API to access playlists, artists, albums, and songs, the app will then use MusixMatch’s API to get the lyrics of the song(s). Then, the lyrics will be sent to IBM’s Watson Tone Analyzer to determine the emotions present in the song(s). This tool will be a way for users to analyze the emotions of their music. 

The wireframe shows the basic flow and functionality of the app. The home screen presents the user with the option to search for a song, artist, album, or playlist. There is also a History button which allows the user to view previously analyzed songs, and an About button which explains what the app does. Once the user has selected the type of item that they want to search for, they are presented with a search screen where they can type in the name of what they are looking for. The search results will show up beneath the search bar. The user can then select an item from the list, and it will lead them to the Analyzing screen which displays the progress of the analysis. Once analysis has completed, the user will be presented with a Results screen which shows the levels of each emotion present in the music selected. The user can then return to the home page.
